## Notes

Built with React, Vite, Supabase, and React Router. Features a custom purple galaxy theme with smooth animations and a card-based layout. Enhanced the basic requirements by implementing separate social media fields (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram) instead of a single URL field for better organization. It was initially challenging to understand Supabase and set up the overall initial website, but through the prework guidance, I was able to understand and implement it.
